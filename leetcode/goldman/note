DATA STRUCTURES
Software engineers at Goldman Sachs regularly design, implement, and manipulate complex data structures. Depending on the role you’re
interviewing for, you may be asked questions about time and space complexities of libraries, and underlying data structures including arrays,
hash-tables, hash-maps, linked lists, stacks, binary trees, heaps, graphs, and queues.
SOFTWARE ALGORITHMS
If you are asked about data structures, you will probably also be tested on your understanding of the most appropriate algorithms to use
with different data structures, such as binary search, dynamic programming, recursion and sorting. You’ll need to show familiarity with the
complexity of the algorithms and of ways to improve them, so try to produce an optimal example rather than one that simply works.
